## FIRST Robotics Team 3081
Our team competes in the [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/), an annual worldwide high school robotics competition.  About 3000 teams participate.  During January and February of each year, we build a robot that we then take to competitions in late winter.
