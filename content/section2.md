## FIRST Tech Challenge team 15530

FTC stands for [FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), and is one of the FIRST Robotics programs.  FIRST Tech Challenge is similar to FIRST Robotics Competition, with some significant differences.


We are currently identifying interested students entering 9th grade at Bloomington Kennedy and students entering 8th grade who live within the Kennedy school boundary.   If you are interested or have further questions, you may email [advisor@kennedyrobotics.com](mailto:advisor@kennedyrobotics.com) or visit us at one of our upcoming events. <!-- TODO add link to our calendar -->
